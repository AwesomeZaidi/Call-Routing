# One-time route cost check
# Desc: You have a carrier route list with 100,000 (100K) entries (in arbitrary order)
# and a single phone number. How quickly can you find the cost of calling this number?

# Copyright Â© 2019 Jayce Azua and Asim Zaidi. All rights reserved.
# ==================================================================================

# By hand:
# Step 0: Copy full phone number.
# Step 1: Open routes file.
# Step 2: Search for phone number using CMD+F (or CTRL+F on windows).
#         If there are no search results, hit backspace in search bar.
# Step 3: Repeat Step 2 til you find a match.
#         In the unlikely event you get several matches, choose the cheapest.
# If you found a match in Step 3, the cost is the number on the right side of the comma.
# Otherwise, we don't have a matching route, tell your manager sorry.

# By code:
