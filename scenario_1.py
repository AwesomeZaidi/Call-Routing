# One-time route cost check
# Desc: You have a carrier route list with 100,000 (100K) entries (in arbitrary order)
# and a single phone number. How quickly can you find the cost of calling this number?

# Our the manual solution inspired by Nicoli Safai
# 0. Copy full phone number.
# 1. Open routes file.
# 2. Search for phone number using `CMD+F` (or `CTRL+F` on windows).
# - If there are no search results, hit `backspace` in search bar.
# 3. Repeat `Step 2` til you find a match.
# - In the unlikely event you get several matches, choose the cheapest.
# If you found a match in Step 3, the cost is the number on the right side of the comma.

# Solution Trade off summary/analysis
# In this scenario we needed the quickest implementation possible and didn't have the
# development time to create an optimized solution. We decided to store all our route
# costs into a list and iterate through it in O(n) time to try and find a matching
# route for our given phone number.
